# Dentist office with wonderful staff. 

I always enjoy my visits with Dr. Lebowitz and his staff. They are always warm, friendly and informative. The staff always communicates any changes with my schedules or visits. Years ago, I used to be afraid of going to the dentist, now I almost fall asleep in the chair during my cleanings. I would always recommend this office to my friends and coworkers. This is the only dentist I would ever go to..
