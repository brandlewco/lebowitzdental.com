Dental crowns and bridges are just two of the many restorative services we provide in our Phoenixdental clinic. The dentist can also perform complex reconstructions to rebuild smiles after dental trauma, congenital problems, or years of dental health neglect. New patients and those seeking second opinions regarding these or other forms of restorative dentistry are encouraged to visit our dental clinic for a consultation.

## Dental crowns

A crown is a permanent covering that fits over an original tooth that is either decayed, damaged, or cracked. Crowns are made of a variety of different materials such as porcelain, gold, or a mix of these materials. All-porcelain ceramic generally provides the most lifelike and natural replacements for teeth. This process typically consists of a minimum of two to three visits to the dentist, over a period of three to four weeks. But, thanks to advanced CEREC technology, our dental clinic can now create precision-crafted custom dental crowns in a single visitto the dentist. Given proper care, your crowns can last a lifetime.

## Bridges

A bridge is a dental device that fills the space where a tooth has been lost. A bridge may be necessary to maintain proper spacing and prevent shifting of the teeth that can lead to bite problems (occlusion), jaw problems, and resultant periodontal disease. Bridges safeguard the integrity of existing teeth and help maintain a healthy, vibrant smile.

The fixed bridge consists of a filler tooth that is attached to two dental crowns. These crowns fit over the existing teeth, and hold the filler tooth and bridge in place.
