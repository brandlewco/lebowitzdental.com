Our Phoenix dental clinic offers a number of effective sleep apnea and snoring solutions to ensure you and your family get better rest, more often. New patients and those seeking second opinions should schedule a consultation to learn more about our Phoenix dental office and approach to treating sleep apnea.

## Sleep apnea is dangerous to your health

A condition that causes you to stop breathing frequently during sleep, sleep apnea is a dangerous health problem that should not be ignored. It can cause loud snoring, daytime sleepiness, morning headaches, loss of energy, forgetfulness, and depression. Worse, sleep apnea can lead to heart attack, or impotence if left untreated.

## Sleep apnea symptoms are common

Experts estimate that about one in four American adults has sleep apnea — and 90 percent of them don&#39;t even know it. Nearly six out of every ten adults are chronic snorers, which can disrupt the sleep of family members and others around them. Fortunately, sleep apnea and snoring are easily treatable problems that our Phoenix dental office can help with.

Our dentists treat sleep apnea using advanced dental appliances to keep breathing airways open comfortably during sleep. These include tongue retention appliances, and mandibular repositioning appliances that gently reposition the jaw during sleep to allow easier breathing. In all, there are about 70 different devices designed to help people with sleep apnea and snoring, including some that are similar to sports mouth guards or orthodontic retainers. Our dental office may recommend any number of these devices, based on your individual symptoms and needs.

## Unique sleep apnea solutions can improve your life

If you or someone you know has used a CPAP machine and mask for sleep apnea, you&#39;ll love the quiet comfort of a custom dental appliance — made just for you and your unique anatomy. You will also have peace of mind knowing that your advanced device is FDA-approved, easily transported on overnight trips, and requires nothing electrical. Best of all, there are no parts to replace or maintain.

Whether you snore or have other symptoms that suggest sleep apnea, you owe it to yourself and your loved ones to try the latest treatment. Call our dental office for information that could save your life or the life of a loved one.
