# Our Services

Phoenix area residents look to Lebowitz Dental Associates for quality, affordable treatment options that cover the full spectrum of lifelong smile improvement and maintenance.

## Discover a dental office where your smile takes center stage

Our customized care plans are intentionally unique — just like your smile. We tailor each plan to optimize dental health and appearance, as well as meet your specific goals. Individual plans may incorporate everything from [teeth whitening](./../../services/cosmetic-dentistry) and [TMJ treatment](./../../services/tmj) to [Invisalign](./../../services/invisalign)® and [sleep apnea](./../../services/sleep-apnea) solutions, and those are just a few of the services available to you at our dental clinic.

## Save time with the latest dental technology

CEREC technology allows Lebowitz Dental Associates to create precision ceramic restorations — dental crowns, fillings, and veneers — during a single appointment in our dental office. In addition to saving time, CEREC delivers durable restorations that can be color-matched for the most natural-looking smile. [Laser periodontal treatment](./../../services/laser-periodontal-treatment) is also available to patients at our dental clinic.

## Access the advanced care you want and need, right here and now

Lebowitz Dental Associates is one of the few Phoenixdental offices qualified to treat temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD, TMJ). TMJ treatment can provide relief to patients suffering from headaches, jaw pain, facial pain, and other related symptoms. In addition to TMJ treatment, our dental clinic offers effective sleep apnea and snoring solutions — endorsed by the American Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine — which are often a more comfortable alternative to CPAP devices.

We also do complex dental reconstruction. This involves the rehabilitation of patients who have suffered dental trauma, congenital defects, or too many years of dental health neglect. Reconstructive dentistry offers life-altering physical, cosmetic, and psychosocial benefits.

## Talk to the dentist about achieving your best smile

Patients new to our dental office meet with the dentist to discuss short- and long-term goals, as well as the broad range of dentistry solutions we can combine to achieve your best smile. It would be our privilege to provide you and your family with quality, convenient, and affordable smile care for life.
