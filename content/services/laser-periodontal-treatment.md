At Lebowitz Dental Associates, our dentists have received advanced specialized training in laser periodontal therapy from the World Clinical Laser Institute and the Academy of Laser Dentistry. Our patients have peace of mind of knowing that they will receive the latest, most effective treatment available from highly qualified dentists at our Phoenix dental office.

## Breakthrough gum treatment with laser technology

The link between gum disease and life-threatening health problems is very real. Periodontal disease has been linked to heart attack, stroke, and other systemic health threats. Many researchers now believe that healthy gums can add ten years to your life! So if your gums are inflamed, swollen, or bleed easily, you should seek treatment immediately — or risk losing years from your life.

Millions of people with these obvious symptoms do not seek treatment. They may fear the imagined pain or have suffered painful gum treatments in the past. Laser dentistry has eliminated the need for otherwise painful gum treatments and invasive surgery.

Modern dentistry now relies more and more on leading-edge laser technology to make treatment faster, easier on the patient and more precise. Enter the dental laser. Laser precision allows the dentists at Lebowitz Dental Associates to remove tooth decay as well as disinfect and shape gum tissue while reducing bleeding, postoperative pain, and swelling. And because dental lasers are so gentle, no anesthesia is required.

## Lasers destroy bacteria

Dental lasers enable our dentists to attack periodontal inflammation and infection at the microscopic level. Our dental office uses laser treatment to seek out and destroy hidden colonies of bacteria. At the same time, it creates an ideal environment for healing. Some lasers even increase circulation and stimulate collagen production at the bottom of your gum pockets. This helps revive or rejuvenate the attachments between your teeth and gums that are vital to your oral and overall health.

Until just a few years ago, this was pure science fiction. Today, it&#39;s a reality that can save your life — made available by Lebowitz Dental Associates, at prices and from dentists you can trust. We would be happy to provide additional details about laser periodontal treatment to new patients, as well as those seeking second opinions.
