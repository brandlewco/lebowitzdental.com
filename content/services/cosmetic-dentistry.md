Find the right cosmetic dentist for you and your family. Lebowitz Dental Associates takes a comprehensive approach to smile design, aesthetics, and function. From teeth whitening and veneers to Invisalign and beyond, our Phoenix dental office will customize a treatment plan to put a dazzling smile on your face.

## Teeth whitening

Teeth will darken over time. Changes in the color of your teeth can be caused by food and beverages (like coffee, tea and cola). Discoloration may also result from childhood medications or illnesses, tobacco use or improper oral hygiene. The reality is that over-the-counter, &quot;too good to be true&quot; teeth whitening solutions typically don&#39;t work. Our goal is to meet the needs of every patient — and every patient&#39;s teeth whitening needs are different. Restoring your natural white smile is a priority for our dental whitening team. We can even whiten your entire smile in one visit to our dental office.

## Veneers

Veneers are thin, semi-translucent porcelain &quot;shells&quot; bonded to your front teeth. Veneers are a great alternative to otherwise painful or more expensive dental procedures. In addition to improving the appearance of your smile, a cosmetic dentist may recommend veneers to correct:

- Spaces between teeth
- Broken or chipped teeth
- Unsightly, stained, or discolored teeth
- Crooked or misshapen teeth

Veneers are a great aesthetic solution that may even help you avoid orthodontic treatment. In most cases, applying veneers is completed in only two visits to our dental office.

## Invisalign®

Straight teeth are also critical to a healthy smile. And Invisalign clear removable aligners deliver the perfect straight smile solution for teens and adults of all ages — [find out more](./../../services/invisalign) about improving your smile with Invisalign.
