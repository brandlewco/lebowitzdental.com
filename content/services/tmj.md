## Understanding TMD disorders

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are often referred to as TMJ â€” the abbreviation for the temporomandibular joint, or jaw joint. TMJ symptoms include facial pain and jaw pain, as well as pain or discomfort in or around the ear, jaw joint, and/or muscles of the jaw, face, temples, and neck on one or both sides. Jaw pain and facial pain may arise suddenly with fluctuating frequency and intensity over months to years. Other symptoms associated with TMJ include headaches and difficulty chewing, as well as clicking, popping, grating, locking, limited opening, or deviating jaw movement.

## Our approach to TMJ treatment

Because there is no known cure for TMJ, our dental office provides TMJ treatment to manage facial pain, jaw pain, headaches, and other associated symptoms. In addition to pain relief, our dentists work to reduce adverse pressure on the jaw joints and restore function of the jaw and normal daily activities. TMJ treatment goals are best achieved by identifying all contributing factors and implementing a well-defined management program that treats physical, emotional, and psychological factors.

As in many musculoskeletal conditions, the signs and symptoms of TMD may be temporary and without serious long-term effects. For these reasons, our dental office makes a special effort to avoid aggressive or nonreversible therapy such as surgery, extensive dental treatment, or orthodontic treatment.

Conservative management techniques such as behavior modification, physical therapy, medication, jaw exercise, and orthopedic appliances (orthotics) have proven to be safe and effective in the majority of TMD cases. Most patients suffering from TMD achieve good long-term relief with conservative (reversible) therapy. Scientific research demonstrates that over 50% of TMD patients treated with conservative management have few or no ongoing symptoms of TMD. New patients and those seeking second opinions regarding TMJ treatment are welcome to visit our dental office for a consultation.

## TMJ treatment options

### Occlusal orthotic

Also known as a splint, night guard, or bite guard that fits over either your upper or lower teeth. An orthotic has many different uses and can be worn either full time or part time, depending on what Lebowitz Dental Associates determines is best for you. Generally, orthotics are used to keep the teeth apart, realign jaw joints and relax jaw muscles.

### Stress management

Learn to manage your daily stress. Our dentists may recommend several techniques to help you do this. They may include biofeedback, relaxation breathing, guided imagery, and sometimes referral to a therapist.

### Physical therapy

Physical therapists are trained professionals who help rehabilitate all types of physical injuries. There are many different techniques that are helpful and the most common include jaw exercises, postural, and ergonomic training, ultrasound, electrical stimulation, and mobilization. Our dental office can help your physical therapist formulate a plan for your treatment.

### Occlusal correction

TMJ treatment can sometimes require improving the way your teeth fit together. Our dentists can accomplish this in different ways. Orthodontics, usually with braces, can move your teeth so they fit together better. In some cases, if the jaws themselves are misaligned, our dental office may recommend that the jaws be moved with a combination of orthodontics and oral surgery called orthognathic surgery. This bite reconstruction is accomplished through extensive dental work like dental crowns, bridges and, if indicated, dental implants. This is done to replace missing teeth or to change the size and shape of the teeth so they fit and function together in a more harmonious manner with the jaw joints and muscles.

### Surgery

Sometimes surgery is done to repair or reconstruct the joints when more conservative treatment has failed to improve comfort and function. While rarely needed, surgery can be performed to eliminate debris that has accumulated in the joint, to repair damaged tissues and to even replace entire joints, similar to the replacement of other joints like knees, hips, and shoulders.
