There are many ways our Phoenix dental office can help complete your smile. Dental implants are often the best option, especially if the missing tooth space is surrounded by teeth not needing treatment. In addition to giving you optimal functionality, dental implants offer a more permanent aesthetic solution.

The dentist would be happy to discuss dental implants and other tooth replacement solutions with you — as well as offer second opinions regarding implant dentistry — when you visit our dental office for a consultation.

## Tooth replacement solutions

Dental implants are artificial tooth replacements that were first developed half a century ago by a Swedish scientist named Per-Ingvar Branemark. Today, implant techniques provide a wide range of tooth replacement solutions, including:

- Single tooth replacement
- Quadrant replacement
- Implant-retained dentures
- Implant-supported dentures

## Teeth in a Day™

Our dental office is proud to offer patients an extraordinary new procedure, enabling the dentist to place four dental implants and a fixed bridge in as little as one appointment. One tooth or an entire mouthful of teeth may be replaced with dental implants and a nonremovable set of new teeth in as little as a day. In most cases there is no bone or sinus grafting, no sinus lift, no incision or sutures needed, and virtually no healing time required.
