# I have been going to Dr. Lebowitz for 27 years! 

I have been going to Dr. Lebowitz for 27 years! I have referred many people to him over the years and they have all been grateful for referring them to him. Dr. Lebowitz headed up a total dental rebuild for my wife and myself, and orchestrated a plan with an Orthodontist and an Implant specialist. The outcome was amazing! The precision of how it all came together was incredible. It has been years now and everything is as stable as ever. I can't say enough about the precise work that Dr. Lebowitz does. He is always on top of the latest dental technology. He has a great staff and Debbie is the absolute best Dental Hygienist that I have been to in my life! She is very thorough with the perfect touch!
