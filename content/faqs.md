# Frequently Asked Questions

## How often should I see a dentist?

The American Dental Association (ADA) recommends visiting a dentist at least twice a year for a checkup and professional cleaning. In alignment with those guidelines, our dental office also recommends a minimum of two visits per year.

## What should I expect during my dental clinic visit?

One of our staff members will compile your medical and dental history during your first visit. We will then examine your teeth and gums, give you an oral cancer screening, make X-rays of your teeth as needed, and complete a TMJ (temporomandibular or jaw joint) exam.

After we review your dental profile, we will discuss recommended next steps with you. If treatment such as a root canal (endodontics), braces (orthodontics), or oral surgery is needed, we will plan to treat you in our dental office or refer you to a specialist. We will discuss your options for treatment and fee payment, and help you determine the best plan to fit your needs.

During regular follow-up visits, we will examine your teeth and gums, screen you for oral cancer, clean your teeth, and make plans for treatment as needed. We will discuss any tooth pain, jaw pain, facial pain, headaches, or other problems you may be experiencing, and answer any questions you may have.

## What does &quot;painless dentistry&quot; mean?

Painless dentistry is a means of ensuring your total experience in our dental office is as stress- and pain-free as possible. We will discuss treatment options to may require no local anesthetic and, whenever possible, alleviate tooth pain, jaw pain, and facial pain by the means most comfortable to you.

## What if I have an emergency?

Please call our dental office as soon as you determine that you have a dental emergency. We will be glad to adjust our schedule to accommodate you for dental emergencies that occur during regular business. After hours, over the weekend, and on holidays, please call our office for the dentist&#39;s emergency contact number.

## Are payment plans available for my dental treatment?

Yes. Our dental clinic accepts many types of dental insurance and will process your claim for you upon receipt of your co-payment. We also offer a payment plan with a low interest rate, and can accept most major credit cards, including MasterCard and Visa.

## Can the dentist whiten my teeth?

There several teeth whitening methods available: in office, overnight, or daily. BriteSmile teeth whitening is done in our dental clinic. One teeth whitening session generally lasts from one and a half to two hours, during which you can read and relax. For overnight teeth whitening, we make an impression of your teeth and create a mouthguard that fits your bite. Each day, you&#39;ll fill the mouthguard with a small amount of bleaching gel and wear it overnight or for a few hours during the day. The overnight teeth whitening process takes approximately two weeks.

Other over-the-counter daily bleaching products are available, but it is important to use any teeth whitening product only under the supervision of a dentist. To achieve the bleaching results you desire, the ADA recommends that you seek the professional advice of a dentist, including examination and diagnosis of the cause of tooth discoloration, before you begin any teeth whitening program.

## What if I have a gap in my teeth, a chipped tooth, or teeth that do not respond to normal teeth whitening methods?

Porcelain veneers are designed to look like your natural teeth and are individually and permanently attached to the fronts of your existing teeth. Bonding utilizes a composite material made of plastic to fill in areas of your teeth and correct any chipping or shape problems. Both porcelain veneers and bonding are color-matched to the rest of your teeth.
